I finally learnt how to use grid in a more FLEXible way. I discovered how powerful grid-template areas can be especially for media queries. I also learnt how to use flexbox side by side by Grid

### Continued development

I'd like to make use of Grid on a larger scale and get more familiar with it's complexities and intricacies.
